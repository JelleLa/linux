# Linux Configuration Files
## About this Repository
* This repository contains miscellaneous Linux files, like desktop entries and configuration files. These are the ones that I *currently* use on my Linux System.
* The .bashrc file is currently set-up for Solus, some aliases have to be edited manually to work with other distributions.
